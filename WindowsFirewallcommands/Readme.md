Set of powershell cmdlets for working with the windows firewall.  commands are ultimately wrappers for netsh commands to allow for backwards compatibility with Windows Server 2008 and up.

Use case was primarily for setting inbound firewall rules so functionality is limited to that functionality.

Unneccessarily verbose information about these commands can be found in this [blog post](https://murrahjm.github.io/Fun-With-Windows-Firewall/).
