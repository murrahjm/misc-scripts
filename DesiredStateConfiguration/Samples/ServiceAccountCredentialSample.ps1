<#
Sample script to illustrate the use of credentials in a configuration document.  Credential objects are passed through parameters to the configuration.  note that multiple credential
objects are supported.  Get-DSCCertificate is a helper function that will retreive the DSC encryption certificate details from a specified machine.  If the specified machine does not
have a dsc encryption certificate it will request one from the enterprise PKI, then return the details.  The return object has a thumbprint value, then the actual certificate file
encoded in a byte array.  Both the thumbprint and certificate file are needed for encrypting a mof.

The attempted use of this sample code would be to handle service account password changes.  the xADUser resource would change the password of the account in Active Directory, 
and the xService resource would set the service logon account and password.  This mostly works, however the xService Test function only checks for a change in the logon username.
If only the password changes for the service account the Set method will never be triggered, so the password in the service configuration would not be updated.  All the rest of the
code around encrypting credentials, etc. works, however.
